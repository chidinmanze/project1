WeatherDine is a website that helps travelers make their travel plans a little smoother by providing weather and restaurants information when a city is searched. The weather information integrated into our site from the OpenWeatherMap API, and restaurant results are integrated from the Zomato API.

The following image demonstrates the application functionality:
